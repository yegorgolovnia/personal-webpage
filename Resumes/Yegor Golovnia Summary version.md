\# Yegor Golovnia

Crypto‑native operations generalist and program & product lead with deep expertise in Quadratic Funding, ecosystem building, and Web3 events. I design and run funding programs, large‑scale conferences, and operating systems that let technical teams, DAOs, and founders focus on building while the coordination layer “just works.” Passionate runner, privacy‑tech nerd, and long‑time contributor to open‑source and public goods.
